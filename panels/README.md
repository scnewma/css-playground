# Panelized Layouts
This is an example that shows how easy it is to create what I like to call a "paneled" layout.

A lot of websites use this to create visual interest between different parts of their page.
They usually have some interesting pictures or something else.  But this is just how to implement this easily.
You should use this as a baseline to produce what you want to.
